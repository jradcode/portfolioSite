# portfolioSite
This is my portfolio web app that displays and showcases snapshots of my coding projects. It is made in Angular 21, Tailwind 4/Materialize CSS, C# ASP.NET Core 10 minimum web API with Entity Framework Core as the ORM, and Neon as the database. It is designed to be as simple as possible.

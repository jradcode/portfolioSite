    Project in progress: Building the Backend API next...

<!--Then need to create the backend api. Then in angular I
  need to create the api.service for the front end api. Then I will have to create a header component which will act as my name and label and contact info.
  Then i will have to create a overall allProjects page that will populate with portfolio project thumbnails. 
  When the thumnails of the project image is clicked then it will go into a carasel component and that component will contain a bunch of pictures
   of the project. on the bottom of each carsel the name of the project, github link, tech/language used, and brief description. I want to put a more 
   detailed challenges/solution text in side the carsel. The carsel can be of videos but I think because I will get a free tier it will have to use images
   to save bandwith. I making this as simple as possible.. I want to organize all the carsels thumbnails as cards. I ant to keep this 1 or 2 pages.
   I may have a linkedin link and a resume page in there (posed as an about page).
   I going to have about 3 or 4 projects. However it may continually be updated added all the time.-->

    <!-- To Do:
    try a another style for the card-project and home page. (it's ok now)
    add project images into assets/images folder
    try an image processor like pillow to make images look better when resizing
    refine header by deleting the linked-in shit and email in header. maybe use icons links instead or move it elsewhere (like at navbar)
    start the write of the frontend angular API in services folder
    start the .net core 10 backend
    integrate that backend with ef core and nen cloud database
    add further functionality for the app to make it easier to add a project use CRUD inside portfolioSite
    maybe add a admin section in the navbar or use some simple authentication for only me to add a project and the user to only view -->

        I was born and raised in San Jose, CA. Growing up in a working-class neighborhood, I was introduced to computers at a very young age. 
        I used the old <span class="text-blue-400 font-semibold cursor-default hover:text-blue-300 transition-colors">Apple IIe/c</span> before there was even a mouse. 
        I used to play the game <em>Oregon Trail</em> in class in elementary school. 
        I also used the old black and gray <span class="text-blue-400 font-semibold cursor-default hover:text-blue-300 transition-colors">Apple Macintosh 128K</span> when it first introduced the concept of a mouse as a <span class="text-white font-medium">point-and-click user interface</span>. 
        We ended up getting an old one for home and used it for writing papers for school and getting used to the operating system and old applications. 
        It had a <span class="text-white font-medium">GUI interface</span> unlike the green command-line driven computers.
      </p>

      <p class="indent-8">
        In middle school, I learned and worked with the old <span class="text-blue-400 font-semibold">Windows 95 Zenith</span> computers. 
        I remember first using a chatbot called <em>Conversation</em> that was the introduction of the new <span class="text-white font-medium">AI LLMs</span> of today. 
        It was a simple chat-like program that helped people improve their typing skills by asking and answering open-ended questions. 
        It was fun messing around with it. I also worked in the computer lab helping turn on and shut down computers after use.
      </p>

      <p class="indent-8">
        For college, I went to <strong>Evergreen Valley Community College</strong> and studied <span class="text-white font-medium">Computer Information Technology (CIT)</span>. 
        CIT focused around learning complex systems and overall computer technology. 
        Instead of math like computer science, it's focused on the meat and potatoes of computers. 
        I learned programming, <span class="text-white font-medium">relational database design</span>, web development, and any new computer technologies at the time. 
        The first programming language I learned was <span class="text-blue-400 font-semibold text-nowrap cursor-default hover:text-blue-300 transition-colors">C++</span> using <span class="text-blue-400">Dev C++</span> as the compiler. 
        I mostly learned basic programming structures and logic and did problems out of the textbook. 
        The problems were typical algebra math-type problems and simple command-line applications like accounting apps and payroll-type apps. 
        It was a strong introduction to programming as <span class="text-blue-400 font-semibold text-nowrap cursor-default hover:text-blue-300 transition-colors">C++</span> has more programming concepts to learn than simple scripting languages.
      </p>

      <p class="indent-8">
        Next, I learned web publishing with <span class="text-blue-400 font-semibold">HTML</span> and <span class="text-blue-400 font-semibold">XHTML</span>, as at the time they were competitors before the rise of <span class="text-blue-400 font-semibold text-nowrap">HTML5</span>. 
        Along with that, I learned <span class="text-blue-400 font-semibold text-nowrap">CSS</span>, as you need to learn that stuff to style web pages. 
        The final class project was to create a full <span class="text-white font-medium">front-end website</span> (no back-end). 
        I created a simple political website with images and text with all the knowledge I learned.
      </p>

      <p class="indent-8">
        Later on, I learned <span class="text-blue-400 font-semibold text-nowrap cursor-default hover:text-blue-300 transition-colors">Perl (Perl 5)</span> which back then was a vital technology to create the back-end of a website to transfer data from the front-end to the server side and used the <span class="text-blue-400">DB</span> and <span class="text-blue-400">CGI modules</span>. 
        <span class="text-blue-400 font-semibold text-nowrap">Perl</span> was much more relevant back then than now, as it was once the "glue" of the internet. 
        Now it's all replaced by <span class="text-blue-400 font-semibold">Python</span>, <span class="text-blue-400 font-semibold">Ruby</span>, <span class="text-blue-400 font-semibold">Java</span>, <span class="text-blue-400 font-semibold">PHP</span>, and other modern languages and frameworks. 
        With <span class="text-blue-400 font-semibold text-nowrap">Perl</span>, I created in class a simple <span class="text-white font-medium">CGI script</span> and a database interface for a simple site. 
        <span class="text-blue-400 font-semibold text-nowrap">Perl's</span> main superpower is <span class="text-white font-medium">text manipulation</span> with a strong <span class="text-white font-medium">Regular Expression engine</span> that is still one of the best by today's standards.
      </p>

      <p class="indent-8">
        Along with <span class="text-blue-400 font-semibold text-nowrap">HTML</span>, I also learned <span class="text-blue-400 font-semibold text-nowrap">JavaScript</span> in another college class. 
        I learned the <span class="text-white font-medium">DOM (Document Object Model)</span> and created small web apps from existing HTML pages. 
        Like for example, creating a clock with images, or building an image <span class="text-white font-medium text-nowrap">carousel</span> or adding animation effects on a site to enhance it. 
        Back then there were few frameworks and I had to create them from scratch.
      </p>

      <p class="indent-8">
        Back then <span class="text-blue-400 font-semibold text-nowrap">Java</span> and <span class="text-white font-medium">Object-Oriented Programming</span> were popular, and I took a class to learn that as well. 
        It was actually one of the hardest languages to learn as you have to learn a new programming design structure rather than a straightforward procedural structure. I felt like you had to think in the future for the design of the app. 
        With <span class="text-blue-400 font-semibold text-nowrap">Java</span>, I created a simple calculator and simple command-line <span class="text-white font-medium">POS system</span>.
      </p>

      <p class="indent-8">
        Later on, I started learning new programming languages myself to keep up with the times. 
        I worked and went to UC Santa Cruz and worked "survival jobs." I learned many different programming languages like <span class="text-blue-400 font-semibold">Python (2 and 3)</span>, <span class="text-blue-400 font-semibold">Django/Flask</span>, <span class="text-blue-400 font-semibold">Ruby/Ruby on Rails</span>, <span class="text-blue-400 font-semibold text-nowrap">Sinatra</span>, <span class="text-blue-400 font-semibold">PHP</span>, <span class="text-blue-400 font-semibold text-nowrap">Laravel</span>, <span class="text-blue-400 font-semibold text-nowrap">Node.js</span>, <span class="text-blue-400 font-semibold">Express/Angular/React/Vue</span>, and more recently learning <span class="text-blue-400 font-semibold">C# ASP.NET, .NET Core/Blazor</span> frameworks throughout my life. I did a little of <span class="text-blue-400 font-semibold">Windows Forms</span> too. I'm more of a <span class="text-white font-medium italic underline decoration-blue-500/50">generalist</span> as it's easier to navigate to different frameworks and languages. I'm more on and off in my IT learning as I learned other things, but always ended up going back to programming technologies.
      </p>

      <p class="indent-8">
        My interests are computers, and I love video games. 
        I like different genres of games from FPS to 4X strategy games. 
        I like to learn and experiment with new things. 
        In terms of operating systems, I prefer <span class="text-blue-400 font-semibold">Windows</span> as I use it to play games and code in <span class="text-blue-400 font-semibold text-nowrap">C#</span>. But I have also learned much of <span class="text-blue-400 font-semibold text-nowrap">Linux</span> and installed many other distros. Overall, I'd say my biggest focus is in <span class="text-white font-medium">web apps</span> and <span class="text-white font-medium border-b border-blue-500/30">full-stack development</span> as I learn how the whole web project is put together.
